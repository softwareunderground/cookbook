# Use cases ideas

A list of use case ideas from the ```Transform 2019``` event.


# Manipulate Seismic velocity model
Processing in package and velocity model is broken. (Has inf or 0). Import data. Visualize the issue. Fix it with an algorithm (replace inf with 0). Export model.

# Ops Geology
Seismic -> Excel -> PPT :C (Superfrownie)
Drilling, esp. real-time drilling
Geology
(Deviation, Striplog, Mudlogs, DVRs, Correlations)

# Cross-Section
Visual integration of logs, formation tops and surfaces. LAS + Formation Tops (Standard treatment of formation tops? → core lib?)

# Modeling / Inversion of Seismic and EM
Import logs and suraces. Build 3D models. Visualize model. Run inversion algorithm. Log data. Create and visualize model.

# Wave-Propagation through synth model
Read SAC-files. Wave propagation through model. View results.

# Landscape Geomorpgology
Read Digi Elevation models. Extract features. Manipulate features. Visualize results.

# Generative Seismics (Synthetics / ML)
Generate seismic datasets for machine learning.

# Clean up set of well logs
Detect duplicates. Establish parent/child relationships. Perhaps with fyzzy wuzzy for logs. 

# Integrate multimethod geophysics into a regional geological model for geohazard assesment

# Load and visualize seismic interpretations
Horizon picks, gridded surfaces., fault sticks, seismic data, well data

# Fracture analysis
Static and dynamic modelling of hydrofractures.

# 3D viz of prestack data and attributes for noise analysis

# Time/depth conversion 
Of volumes and maps

# Seismic Inversion
Invert pre-stack seismic for P-impedance or S-impedance

# Convert LAS files to a map in a shape file

# Event localization in microseismic monitoring

# Convert SEGY to live traces in QGIS

# Petrophysical Plot Template 

# Characterize porosity from thin sections

# Display core images together with logs
